# Chess

You can play manually or run one of the example games from directory `examples`.

Run an example with command: `cat example/short-play.txt - | cargo run`

If the game does not end with the output, you can continue manually.

## Future work

Note this is marked future work not as "to do", because this project served as a Rust learning excercise, not Chess engine deep dive.

### Game logic

Castling, en passaint, pawn last rank transformation.

### Notation

Portable game notation.

### Tests

Integration tests simulating games from database of downloaded games checking expected outcome.
